    "#### GC Contents In DNA\n",

    "#### Usefulness\n",
    "+ In polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments, the GC-content of short oligonucleotides known as primers is often used to predict their annealing temperature to the template DNA. \n",
    "+ A higher GC-content level indicates a relatively higher melting temperature.\n",
    "+ DNA with low GC-content is less stable than DNA with high GC-content\n",
    "+ High GC content DNA can make it difficult to perform PCR amplication due to difficulty in designing a primer long enough to provide great specifity\n",

    "\n",
    "#### AT Contents in DNA\n",
    "+ AT content is the percentage of nitrogenous bases in a DNA or RNA molecule that are either Adenine (A) or Thymine (T)\n",
    "+ AT base pairing yields only 2 hydrogen bonds"
